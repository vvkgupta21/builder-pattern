//The users will be created with the overloaded constructor solves the readability issue to some extent but depends a lot on the parameters of the constructor.

//There are issues with the overloaded constructors
//
//You must produce all the possible permutations and combinations of the constructors.
//It is difficult to manage a lot of constructors.
//It is difficult to add or remove parameters from the constructors as it would affect a lot of them at once which can lead to compilation errors.
//It violates the Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY) software principle as a lot of code is repeated in the constructors.
//Users can get overwhelmed with so many constructors and can get confused about which one to use.
